## Customizations

Noteworthy customizations I made.

### clock-weather-card
I was looking for a weather card as compact as possible. clock-weather-card was a good start, but with its default settings, it wasn't compact enough for me. I used lovelace-card-mod to add some custom CSS to it. I assume it is pretty hacky, but it works. This is the full YAML for this card:

```
type: custom:clock-weather-card
entity: weather.forecast_home
temperature_sensor: sensor.aussentemperatur
humidity_sensor: sensor.aussentemperatur_2
hide_today_section: true
forecast_rows: 3
card_mod:
  style: |
    ha-card {
      --bar-height: 1em !important;
    }
```

### Conditional coloring for humidity sensors and windows
I was looking for a way to notice high humidity and opened windows at a glance. This was an easy one since Bubble-Card offers [styling](https://github.com/Clooos/Bubble-Card#styling) by default.

This is the custom style I used for humidity:
```
.switch-button {
  background-color: ${state > '64' ? 'indianred' : ''} !important;
}
```

This is the custom style I used for windows:
```
.switch-button {
  background-color: ${state === 'on' ? '#e2aa60' : ''} !important;
}
```

### Hide completed items on To-do list card

Completed items are still displayed in the To-do list card. They can't be hidden by default.

I used lovelace-card-mod to add some custom CSS to it.

This is the full YAML for this card:

```
type: todo-list
entity: todo.zuhause
card_mod:
  style: |
    .completed {
      display: none;
    }
    .header:not([role=seperator]) {
      display: none;
    }
    .divider {
      display: none;
    }
```
